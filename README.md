# Travana

Open source Android application that utilizes LPP API to display public transport related information.

## About

Travana was started by two ambitious developers learning how to develop Android applications.
The project was initially called "LppTransit" and it's whole idea was to give users the ability to 
see **live bus location** on the map, to get better understanding of the live arrival predictions
available on bus stations.

The project's UI/UX was never formally defined. It's entire development was ad hoc, implementing
features seen on other existing popular LPP Android apps while still trying to improve on said
features.

## Future

Since Travana was developed in 2019, a rewrite is planned with a fresh, new and thought-out
UI/UX that tries to bring information to users more clearly and consistently. It is still 
in early stage of development where only the UI/UX mockups exist. Technology/framework that will be
used still is not decided yet with discussions regarding whether this should be 2 separate native apps
(Android and IOS) or an app build with a multi-platform framework.

## Contributions

Personally I think this project should be treated as **deprecated**. What do I mean by that?
That you shouldn't expect me accepting contributions with newly implemented features. This project
is **legacy** software where mostly only bug fixes are welcome.
